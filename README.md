# Iris-Flower-Classification-with-Machine-Learning

# Description

There are three species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which vary in size. Assume for a moment that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species. Your 
hereÂ task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.


# Steps followed to predict the Iris Flower

- Load the data
- Analyze and visualize the dataset
- Model training
- Model Evaluation
- Testing the model

# Summary

In this project, we learned to train our own supervised machine learning model using Iris Flower Classification Project with 
Machine Learning. Through this project, we learned about machine learning, data analysis, data visualization, model creation, etc.
